  <h2>Discussion and Findings:</h2>
  <p>On this page we extrapolate upon the results of our research, both from mapping data and in the stories gathered from scanning workers. From the results of our map we can see that the majority of scanning has been taking place overseas and outside of much lauded library partnerships. From the results of gathering workers’ stories we can see a trend of dissatisfaction, underwhelming compensation, and pain among workers. It is important to note that while most of the scans are happening in Asia, of the stories we’ve been able to gather, none of them specifically name working at any of the Asian sites. </p>
  <p>From investigating the scraped data we can see IA moving much of its scanning operations to China and the Philippines. This move to China happened in July 2009. And the move to the Philippines happened in September 2018. However, IA does not report a relationship with either contractor until 2017 in their I990 tax returns. 990s require an organization to report relationships with any contractor paid more than $50,000/year. Through comparing the scraped data with the 990s, we deduced that IA never paid a digitization services contractor more than $50,000/year before 2017. Then, IA began paying Datum Data Co Ltd. $738,677/year for book scanning services. </p>
